Blog Review 
The GeeksforGeeks article “Why Data Analysis is Important” talks about why data is so valuable in today’s world. I think data is an important resource for engineers because without it, most technologies cannot even start. The blog explains that data analysis is used in many areas like business, healthcare, finance, and government. For example, in business it helps understand customers, in healthcare it improves treatment, and in government it supports better policy making. It also mentioned that data analysis is not just about keeping data but also about using it for research, innovation, and reducing risks.
While reading, I felt that data analysis alone mostly just tells us what already happened. But if we add neural networks, then the system can also learn from past patterns and predict what might happen in future. This reminded me of finance because I had read an article where people were asking if AI like ChatGPT could replace financial experts. It made sense but I also felt that AI sometimes fails when sudden things happen, like a market crash or unexpected expenses. At those times, humans understand the situation better.
That gave me an idea of how neural networks could make finance more personal. In this analogy, the inputs can be things like a person’s income, spending habits, savings, and risk appetite. The weights will show which factors matter more. So if someone is a big spender, the spending input will get a higher weight. The bias could be the lifestyle or long-term goal of the person. The output would be a financial plan which is not the same for everyone but based on that person’s behavior. The output in this case could be a financial plan tailored to that person’s behavior. Instead of giving the same advice to everyone, the network would adapt and say, “Even if you spend daily, you can still secure growth by investing a fixed percentage.” The activation function in this case makes the model practical, because it handles sudden changes in income or spending in a smoother way.
This made me realize neural networks can go beyond numbers and actually adapt to human behavior. Even though finance is not really my area, the thought came in my mind, and it showed me how powerful data analytics becomes when mixed with deep learning.
