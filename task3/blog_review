Blog Review 
The blog “Deep Learning (Part 1): Understanding Basic Neural Networks” explains the main ideas of neural networks and why they are important. Neural networks mimic the human brain to process information and identify patterns in data. They are the foundation of deep learning and machine learning. Because they resemble how brain neurons communicate, they are called “neural.” Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computer models inspired by the architecture of biological neural networks.
The blog also highlights how neural networks are already used in the real world. Google bought DeepMind in 2014, and its AlphaGo program defeated a professional Go player in 2016. Facebook introduced DeepFace in 2015, which could identify faces with high accuracy using millions of parameters. These examples show how ideas from research have turned into practical tools and breakthroughs that affect our daily lives.
After showing these applications, the blog explains the technical basics. A perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network. It takes several binary inputs and produces a single output. A single-layer perceptron has only input and output layers and is very limited. Multi-layer perceptrons add one or more hidden layers, making them much more powerful. By combining neurons together, the output of one neuron becomes the input for others, creating deeper networks.
Neural networks work through layers of neurons: the input layer receives the data, the hidden layers perform computations, and the output layer gives the final result. This process involves weights, biases, and activation functions. Weights decide how important an input is, while biases adjust the result. Activation functions such as sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh introduce non-linearity, which allows the network to learn complex and advanced patterns. Without activation functions, neural networks would not be effective at solving tasks like image recognition or language processing.
The blog presents both the practical applications and the technical foundations of neural networks in a simple and clear way. I liked how it showed that powerful results can emerge from simple building blocks. Neural networks are made up of many small, basic concepts, but when combined, they are able to solve problems that once seemed impossible.
